## Template

This is a template for a post.
Note that draft is set to true. if you do not want to show it.

The css chunck arranges that the paragraphs (p) are justified and the figure captions (figcaption) are centered. Be sure to have engine: knitr in the YAML section.
Since Here the very first thing was used a css code, Quarto will try to render this file using jupyter engine. So I have specified engine: knitr just to be in a safe side. But seems to be necessary indeed. Beware!


For the time being in each qmd, maybe one day set globally?

In the post:
- the title appears on top.
- the subtitle just below.
- then the categories and then 
- the description

Below there is the author and the published date,
Next modified date and then follows the text in the body.

On the "home" one finds the image then the title.
Next line is the calculated reading time,
followed by the categories
the description and finally 
author name and publication date.

This template is used by simply making a copy of the containing folder and editing the index file.

Follows the description

If a pdf needs to be generated, include the following in the YAML section (or something alike)

<!-- 
format:
  pdf:
    toc: false
    toc-depth: 2
    number-sections: false
    number-depth: 2
    output-file: "post20240823"
    output-ext:  "pdf"
-->
