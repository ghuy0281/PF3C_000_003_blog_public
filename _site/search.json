    "text": "Inspiration\nOnce upon a time …, no, that is how fairy tales begin. And they usually end well. Not this tale. So, some time ago I met a general manager. Actually I think more of it as a division manager as he was supposed to manage, well, a division. Job title inflation or job content deflation, who will tell.\nAfter some chatting he mentioned that he would dig into invoices sent and prepare a Pareto plot to see which customers contributed most to the income of the organization.\nI was aware of questions floating around about which projects were contributing the most to the overall income, which projects brought a lot of work but not a corresponding decent amount of revenue and which projects had a better revenue to effort ratio. So, I suggested that maybe it would be better to make a whale plot instead of a Pareto plot. The response surprised me, although at that time there was not too much that could suprise me anymore.\n\nWhale plot, Pareto plot, whatever you call it, it’s all the same.\n\nHuh? Okay, your way. End of discussion. But I don’t think so. They may be related, but that is not the same as the same."

    "text": "Pareto plots\n\nA little history\nLet’s recall: Pareto plots. A Pareto plot or chart refers to a visualisation of the Pareto principle. According to this pinciples, a large percentage of effects often come from a small percentage of causes. The Pareto principle was named after Vilfredo Pareto (°1848 – +1923). He was an Italian economist, among other things, and his research on wealth distribution in Italy revealed that approximately 80% of the land was owned by 20% of the population. This observation, along with others he made about unequal distribution in other areas, resulted in what is now called the Pareto Principle. It is commonly also named the “80/20 rule”, although it was not called as such by Pareto himself.\nA Pareto plot, in general, displays the relative frequency, amount, size or severity of problems, defects, or causes in a process. The plot combines a bar chart and a line plot. The bars represent individual categories or factors. The height of each bar indicates the magnitude of that factor. So, in Pareto’s original research, each bar would represent a land owner and the height of the bar would be the area of land owned. Note that the data are ordered and plotted from large to small. The line plot shows the cumulative total of the factors. For clarity this cumulative total is most often showen as a percentage.\nBy the way, according to a source1, Pareto did not only not mention the “80/20 rule”, he apparently even did not make a Pareto plot himself. It was Joseph Juran (°1904 – +2008), well known for his work on quality and quality management, who named the Pareto plot after Vilfredo Pareto.\nMark Paradies suggests that graphics expert William Playfair (°1759 - +1823) drew the first graph that can be considered a Pareto chart (without the cumulative line however). It was published in 1786, about 62 years before the birth of Vilfredo Pareto.\nWilliam Playfair’s chart, about Exports and Imports of Scotland to and from different parts for one Year from Christmas 1780 to Christmas 1781, published in The Commercial and Political Atlas of 1786, is shown in Figure 1. In this bar chart Scotland’s imports and exports from and to 17 countries in 1781 are represented. It is said to be the first quantitative graphical form that did not locate data either in space, as had coordinates and tables, or time, as had Priestley’s timelines. Yet, it offers a solution that allows quantitative comparison.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: William Playfair’s use of bar charts in 1786\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the other hand2, the idea of representing data as a series of bars had earlier been published by Jacobus de Sancto Martino and attributed to Nicole Oresme in the 14th century.\nI guess Stigler’s law of eponymy3 plays here as well.\nAnyhow, back to business.\n\n\nShow me the data\nI am not sure I have ever seen the result of the exercise. But it should not be too difficult to simulate the outcome of the experiment. Only, I do not have the data. Detailed financial data are trade secrets and they are not generally available.\nNow, there are also data that were easily accessible, were not labelled as confidential and that were not having commercial value: time sheets.\nWhen, and how long, did someone work on a specific project for a given customer? Of course, this does not give the complete image. It does not tell anything about material cost, other direct and indirect costs, overhead, mark-up, processes used, etcetera. And, since customers and project topics are anonymised as a standard procedure, confidentiality is safeguarded as well. So the recorded working hours devoted to projects for a given customer, can serve for educational purposes.\n\nSo, here we go. It took, as usual, a lot of data cleaning and exploratory data analysis. From the first use of the time registration software (2008-02-25) to the last day of the paid subscription to the service (2023-02-28) 24 people registered more than 190000 hours in more than 550 projects for more than 80 customers (internal and external), equivalent to more than 120 person-years.\nAs the starting point was invoices and (industrial) customers, the data cleaning implied sub-setting the complete data set and taking into account the industrial customers only. Calculating the number of person-months worked for each of the customers over the 15-year period gives the Pareto plot in Figure 2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Pareto plot (person month vs customer)\n\n\n\n\n\nCertainly looks like a Pareto plot. But what do we learn from this graph?\nWell, 12 percent of the customers are responsible for about 80 percent of the work performed. And a very few good performers stand out, some contributed less and quite a lot were, say, small contributors.\nThat’s about it. The point is: what do we do with this information? We have a nice plot, but what are the business decisions that result from this analysis? Why did we make this plot again in the first place? “To see which customers contributed most to the income of the organization”. Now we know (pretending that the amount of work perfomed reflect the income generated), so let’s go back to our day-to-day routine. Or was it the goal to have some business decisions made, based on the analysis?\nWhat is we dropped the “small contributors” in the future, focussing on the “good customers”? A lot less customers and a focus on the smaller number of customers generating the higher incomes. We could even do that with less personnel, so an extra cost reduction as a collateral benefit. Great idea!\nNot. It simply does not recognize some very basic rules in business, the first is know your business, know what you are doing”. In this case we are not discussing a product mix with some successfull products and some that are hard to sell, where we can decide to change production volumes in favour of the one or the other. The “products” are contract research projects for different customers. So each project, even for the same customer, is unique. And we lumped together all projects for a customer into a single bin.\nShouldn’t we look into the individual projects then? That would already a better idea, but from day-to-day experience on the workfloor we also know that there were customers with only a few projects over the time span of about 15 years, while others had several projects. Some projects were bigger than others as well. So a Pareto plot based on projects would have many more bins, but the projects for different customers would be intermixed on such plot. Dropping small projects is likely to affect mutliple customers that also had bigger projects running. In the end you could be denying services that you are capable of supplying to some of your best customers … Probably not a great move either.\nA second rule is “the future is not the same as the past”. It is not because a successfull track record can be shown for the past 15 years, that it will continue in the future. The opposite is true as well. But related to dropping customers that do not contribute to the organization’s income at this moment: remember how it started with the highest contributing customer. One day the started with a small project, more a test case than a real project. Later there was a real project, still small, and when confidence grew the number of projects and their size grew. And now you are telling me that you want to drop the customers with small contributions? One or more that could grow to be you next block buster?\nThere is also a third rule, stating that “the purpose of doing business is making profit”. Some say it is the first and only rule."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nWhen I wander around the internet, there are several places where I tend to linger a little longer. One of them is the blog of Antoine Soetewey (“AS”): Stats and R1. This time my attention was drawn by the post of 2023-12-06, about the probability of two people in a meeting or team having the same initials2.\nThis is the introduction of the “problem”, in Antoine’s words:\n\nLast week, I joined a team to work on a collaborative project. The team was already established for a few months, with several scientists working together on the project. For simplicity, they used to sign documents, mention colleagues in emails, etc. with their initials (the first letter of their first name followed by the first letter of their last name).\n\nA couple of days after joining the project, when I needed to sign my first document with my initials, we realized that another person in the team had the exact same initials than me. This was not really an issue, as we decided that I would write my initials backward, that is, “SA” instead of “AS”, and the other person would keep signing with “AS” as usual.\n\nIt could have stopped here. However, the idea to write a post about this rather trivial anecdote came to me when the team leader claimed, in the middle of a meeting: “That’s very unfortunate that you two have the same initials! What are the chances of this happening to us?!”. We spent a couple of minutes trying to estimate this probability, which in the end were mostly based on our intuitions rather than on a formal calculation. This piqued my curiosity.\n\nAnd my curiosity as well … for several reasons:\n\nWhen signing documents, pages, and e-mails, can one not just use unique digital signatures these days? But that spoils the question of course.\nWhen using paper and pen for writing, are the initials in written form (paraph) not sufficiently different? Maybe fine for old-school legal documents and signoff lists, but in daily e-mails and meeting minutes? Nah.\nWhy not use four characters? Actually, that is the origin of this blog’s name. The abbreviation for my name as it was used in a company. We also used that system for minutes of meetings with externals. A meeting with Antoine would then have ASOE and GHUY after the names in the attendance list, in the abbreviation of names mentioned in the text and in the action list for instance.\nOr go the full way: as-8345e5fc-8d4c-4a4c-9e44-01f9c23956cb\n\nThe latter, combining the initials with a unique UUID (or GUID)3, is certainly the best regarding uniqueness. A bit hard to memorise… The UUID is generated by an R package4 as an exercise.\n\nGiven that the project we are working on requires the use of simulations, I decided to focus on answering this question via simulations in R. That being said, as for most simulations, it is a good practice to verify these results. This is done using probability theory. This comparison will allow to assess the truthfulness of results obtained through simulations.\n\nFurthermore, I thought that it would be a nice way to illustrate methods not often presented in my posts: for loops, replications and writing functions in R.\n\n\nI would like to reflect somewhat more on this problem, but I do not intend to copy his whole blog page, so please look at Antoine’s original post for details first."

    "text": "Reflections on the results\nWelcome back…\nLet’s summarize the conditions and results.\n\nAS starts, for his team of eight persons, by creating a vector of size eight, corresponding to the initials of each of the team members.\n\nIt is checked whether there are duplicate initials.\n\nIt is estimated, via simulations, how likely it is that at least two persons have the same initials among the team. So the vector of eight sampled initials is replicated (or rather re-drawn) a large number of times, namely 1000 times.\n\nA matrix of eight rows and 1000 columns is the result. Each row corresponds to the sampled initials of a person, and each column corresponds to one simulated team of 8 people. It remains to compute how many of these 1000 teams have at least two persons with the same initials. Under the given conditions it was 41. It can be stated that the probability of having duplicate initials is 4.1 %.\nAs the construction of the teams is a random process, this probability will vary each time a simulation is run. In the end, 100 simulations were carried out and returned a list of 100 probabilities. AS shows a histogram and a boxplot to demonstrate that the probability that at least two persons share the same initials among a team of 8 people is most likely between 3.5% and 4.5%.\nWe could use his data, with permission, to calculate the mean as well.\n\n# ==============================================================================\n# Calculate mean and standard deviation for AS' 100 replicate data\n#\nd_as &lt;- c(0.032, 0.037, 0.040, 0.043, 0.033, 0.042, 0.039, 0.047, 0.045, 0.038, 0.052, 0.042,\n          0.042, 0.040, 0.023, 0.044, 0.041, 0.039, 0.036, 0.048, 0.041, 0.037, 0.027, 0.030,\n          0.052, 0.038, 0.043, 0.035, 0.038, 0.045, 0.047, 0.044, 0.030, 0.036, 0.036, 0.048,\n          0.038, 0.045, 0.044, 0.034, 0.031, 0.043, 0.045, 0.034, 0.049, 0.047, 0.051, 0.036,\n          0.051, 0.040, 0.043, 0.044, 0.038, 0.049, 0.043, 0.050, 0.035, 0.043, 0.048, 0.038,\n          0.041, 0.044, 0.039, 0.045, 0.033, 0.057, 0.036, 0.043, 0.041, 0.041, 0.041, 0.041,\n          0.038, 0.044, 0.031, 0.034, 0.049, 0.041, 0.040, 0.034, 0.032, 0.036, 0.049, 0.047,\n          0.048, 0.038, 0.038, 0.037, 0.036, 0.037, 0.043, 0.040, 0.026, 0.049, 0.046, 0.044,\n          0.048, 0.038, 0.026, 0.029)\nn_as &lt;- length(d_as)\nm_as &lt;- mean(d_as)\ns_as &lt;- sd(d_as)\n#\n\nBased on the data, a mean of 4.05 % is observed, with a standard deviation of 0.65 %.\nIt is possible to compare this result obtained through simulations with results obtained from probability theory. In fact, AS reports that the number of possible two-letter initials (TLI) in the case of a team of 8 persons is 4.07218 %.\nOf course this brings up an obvious question: why simulate and come to variable results (due to the random nature) if one can calculate the exact result from probability theory? For me at least, a satisfying answer is that we can prove that the same result can be obtained, giving confidence to the simulation method under conditions where the result could not be calculated analytically in a convenient way, or not at all.\nBut also other questions arise. Is the result close enough to the true value? What is the effect of the number of re-draws?\nFurthermore, the two-letter initials are generated by random selection of a first initial and random selection of a second initial, both from the list of 26 characters of the Latin alphabet. It is mentioned by AS that “all letters of the alphabet had the same probability of occurring, meaning that all pairs of initials were equally probable. This is probably not the case in reality, as a first and last name starting both with X is not as probable as a first and last name starting respectively with M and K.” Now this also makes a nice case and in fact makes the whole question, or better the solution, pretty region dependent. Imagine for instance parts of the world where a lot of people have names like Kim, Nguyen, etc.\nAnd when we go from two-letter to four-letter initials, we need the actual family names, as a random selection of three characters is not really realistic in real life. Well, not sure what the future brings (considering names like X Æ A-Xii). Well, some mothers (and fathers) do have them, as they used to say. And in areas with frequently occuring family names, it remains a problem of course.\nAs AS states: this bias could be limited by specifying different weights when sampling initials."

    "text": "Variation on a theme\n\nSetting the scene\nWell, we differ somewhat in taste. Probably because I am more of an experimenter and not really a mathematician nor statistician, but repeats and replicates could be better defined in my opinion. With replicates experimenters (in chemical analysis for instance) point to the execution of a lab experiment/analysis under exact the same conditions. In the case of a simulation experiment this would correspond to the use of the same sequence of random numbers. This will then also give exactly the same result. So repeats, with different random numbers, are to be considered.\nTo avoid confusion, and for the purpose of this post, I will consider the random selection of two-letter initials as drawing M&M-like5 candies from a huge6 bag containing candies with all possible combinations of two letters printed on them. Obviously: I call the determination of one random two-letter initial a draw of a two-letter initial. In the same context I call the draw of a team the drawing (with putting back after each two-letter initial) of eight M&M’s. I have a number of repeats, in order to allow the determination of the probability of having duplicate two-letter initials and the number of experiments to indicate how many times the number of repeats is carried out. Recall that, in our definitions, AS used 1000 as number of repeats and 100 as number of experiments.\n\n\nAdapting the code to my taste\nI will further explore some aspects of the same type of simulation. So let’s start with a variation on the theme. At first, the letters are randomly sampled among all 26 letters of the Latin alphabet. The code below does essentially the same as in the Stats and R blog, apart from minor changes, reflecting personal taste and the use of code chunks in a Quarto, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system7 and the preference for a long data format (working with one team (= one observation) per row)8.\n\n# ==============================================================================\n# Simulation, following the method of AS\n# ==============================================================================\n# FUNCTIONS\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ncmps_team_as &lt;- function(n_persons) {\n#\n# Draw a team: compose a team of n_persons, the AS way. \n# Dataframe df contains one row with n_persons two-letter initials, AS style, \n# and the last column is the percentage of unique initials in this team \n# composition.\n#\n  df &lt;-replicate(n_persons, \n                 paste0(sample(LETTERS, size = 1), \n                        sample(LETTERS, size = 1)))\n  df &lt;-  as.data.frame(t(df))\n  df$count &lt;- apply(df,1,function(x) sum(!duplicated(x)))\n  df$count &lt;- 100*df$count/n_persons\n  return(df)\n}\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#\n# Set the number of persons in a team and the number of teams to be composed \n# (= number of repeats)\n#\nn_persons &lt;- 8     # number of persons per team [AS: 8]\nn_teams &lt;- 1000    # number of repeats (teams)  [AS: 1000]\nn_exper &lt;- 100     # number of experiments      [AS:  100]\n#\nd_as &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(data=NA, ncol=2, nrow=n_exper))\n#\nrepro &lt;- FALSE  # set TRUE for reproducible random numbers\n#\n# Filename for file to accept team compositions, delete first\n# if old file exists\n#\nfl &lt;- \"exp_results.csv\"\nif (file.exists(fl)) {\n  file.remove(fl)\n  fate &lt;- \"File deleted\"\n} else {\n  fate &lt;- \"No file found\"\n}\n#\nfor (xp in 1:n_exper) {\n#\n# Set a seed and compose the first team\n#\nzaad &lt;- xp\n#\nif (repro == TRUE) {\n  set.seed(zaad)\n}\nelse\n{\n a=as.numeric(Sys.time())\n set.seed(a)\n}\n#\nteams &lt;- cmps_team_as(n_persons)\n#\n# Fill up the teams dataframe with the remaining teams\n#\nfor (i in 2:n_teams) { \n   team &lt;- cmps_team_as(n_persons)\n   teams &lt;- rbind(teams, team)\n}\n#\ncnt_unique &lt;- length(which(teams$count==100))\npct_multip &lt;- 100*(1-cnt_unique/n_teams)\n#\n# Use write.table to append teams to the file\n# (as write.csv overwrites even with append=TRUE (?)\n#\nwrite.table(teams, file=fl, append = TRUE, row.names=FALSE, , sep=',')\n#\nd_as[xp, 1] &lt;- fl\nd_as[xp, 2] &lt;- pct_multip\n}\n#\nn_as &lt;- length(d_as)\nm_as &lt;- mean(d_as[,2])\ns_as &lt;- sd(d_as[,2])\nrsd_as &lt;- 100*s_as/m_as\n\nBased on the data, a mean of 3.92 % is observed, with a standard deviation of 0.55 %. Which is pretty much the same result as AS in his original post.\nOne further modification is needed if I want to use a different probability profile for the letters. I made some changes to the code but kept it such that a uniform letter probability can still be used as before, as a validation tool as well.\n\n# ==============================================================================\n# Simulation, allowing non-uniform distribution of letters\n# ==============================================================================\n# FUNCTIONS\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------#\ncmps_team_gh &lt;- function(n_persons, df_p) {\n#\n# Draw a team: compose a team of n_persons, the GH way. \n# Supply a dataframe with probabilities for all letters in df_p\n# Output dataframe df contains one row with n_persons two-letter initials, \n# and the last column is the percentage of unique initials in this team \n# composition.\n#\n  team &lt;- replicate(n_persons, NA)\n  for (i in 1:n_persons) { \n# \n# Draw the first initial, then the second and add to the team\n# \n    urn &lt;- runif(2)\n    check &lt;- which(with(df_p, df_p$low &lt;= urn[1] & df_p$high &gt; urn[1]))\n    lttr &lt;- df_p$lttr[check]\n    check &lt;- which(with(df_p, df_p$low &lt;= urn[2] & df_p$high &gt; urn[2]))\n    lttr &lt;- paste0(lttr, df_p$lttr[check])\n    team[i] &lt;- lttr\n    }\n#\n  df &lt;- team\n  df &lt;-  as.data.frame(t(df))\n  df$count &lt;- apply(df,1,function(x) sum(!duplicated(x)))\n  df$count &lt;- 100*df$count/n_persons\n  return(df)\n}\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#\n# Define the probability distribution function\n#\n# All letters have equal probability of occurence in this case\n#\ndf_p &lt;- data.frame(lttr = LETTERS, prob = replicate(26, 1/26))\n#\n# Prepare to pass on to random draw\n#\ncolnames(df_p) &lt;- c('lttr', 'low')\ndf_p$high &lt;- df_p$low\n#\ndf_p[1,2] &lt;- 0.00\ndf_p[26,3] &lt;- 1.00\n#\nfor (i in 2:26) { \n  j &lt;- i-1\n  df_p[i,3] &lt;- df_p[j,3]+df_p[i,2]\n  df_p[i,2] &lt;- df_p[j,3]\n}\n#\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#\n# Set the number of persons in a team and the number of teams to be composed \n# (= number of repeats)\n#\nn_persons &lt;- 8     # number of persons per team [AS: 8]\nn_teams &lt;- 1000    # number of repeats (teams)  [AS: 1000]\nn_exper &lt;-100      # number of experiments      [AS:  100]\n#\nd_gh &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(data=NA, ncol=2, nrow=n_exper))\n#\nrepro &lt;- FALSE  # set TRUE for reproducible random numbers\n#\nfor (xp in 1:n_exper) {\n#\n# Set a seed and compose the first team\n#\nzaad &lt;- xp\n#\nif (repro == TRUE) {\n  set.seed(zaad)\n}\nelse\n{\n a=as.numeric(Sys.time())\n set.seed(a)\n}\nteams &lt;- cmps_team_gh(n_persons, df_p)\n#\n# Fill up the teams dataframe with the remaining teams\n#   \nfor (i in 2:n_teams) { \n   team &lt;- cmps_team_gh(n_persons, df_p)\n   teams &lt;- rbind(teams, team)\n}\n#\ncnt_unique &lt;- length(which(teams$count==100))\npct_multip &lt;- 100*(1-cnt_unique/n_teams)\n#\n# Uncomment for writing csv data files per experiment\n#\nflx &lt;- paste0('exp_', formatC(xp, width=4, flag=\"0\"))\n#\nd_gh[xp, 1] &lt;- flx\nd_gh[xp, 2] &lt;- pct_multip\n}\n#\nn_gh &lt;- length(d_gh)\nm_gh &lt;- mean(d_gh[,2])\ns_gh &lt;- sd(d_gh[,2])\nrsd_gh &lt;- 100*s_gh/m_gh\n\nBased on the data from this modified code, a mean of 3.99 % is observed, with a standard deviation of 0.61 %. Again, taking into account the random nature of the process, pretty much the same result as AS.\nThe results can be compared in the following boxplot. The blue boxes have their usual meanings in the geom_boxplot context. The lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles). The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 * IQR from the hinge (where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles). The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. I added the mean (red dot) as well, The green horizontal line corresponds to the actual probabilistic outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparative boxplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\nThe results are quite similar, re-running the simulations with different random numbers will change the results somewhat. However the general conclusion about the magnitude of the probability of having duplicate two-letter initials remains valid.\nFor the current purpose, having a rough idea about the probability of duplicate two-letter initials in teams of eight people, this may suffice.\nWhat strikes me however is the pretty large Relative Standard Deviation (aka Coefficient of Variation). In this set of experiments we find 13.9% and 15.3% for the AS and GH case respectively. Note that the result is indeed random. Sometimes the first case (AS) gives a smaller Relative Standard Deviation, sometimes the second (GH).\nThe Relative Standard Deviation is however higher than I expected. After all, we ran quite some simulations. This raises questions on how the mean and standard deviation depend on the choices of the parameters. Something to explore later.\nFor now, I conclude that I have validated the code and that I can use it for a next post. For the time being the same set of parameters (1000 as the number of repeats and 100 as the number of experiments) will be used there.\nNote that, on the fly, we “penciled down” all teams (100 x 1000 repeats, or 100000 teams).\nThis allows us to do a lot more with the data. It all started with a person with a given two-letter initial joining an existing team of seven people.\nThe probability of having a given specific two-letter initial (say AS, XY or QQ) under the assumed conditions (ie all letters are created equal) is 0.147929 %. So, if we would be drawing 100000 times, each combination would pop up 147.93 times.\nFor the simulated data we can tally the number of teams that have specific members on board. Say we are looking for “AS” (does not really matter here as all letters are created equal).\n\nTeams with “AS” as “member eight” of the team: 141 (compare to our expected 147.93),\nTeams with one “AS” as old member (“member 1 through 7”): 1057 ,\nTeams with two old “AS” members: 0,\n\nTeams with three “AS” members in the original team: 0,\n\nBut what we are actually looking for is adding “AS” as the eighth member to a team of seven people, where there is already one (or more) “AS” in the original team. It turns out that, in this simulation, there are only 0 out of 100000 teams. Or a probability of only 0 %. So indeed quite a rare event."

Maar ook interessant.\nHet begon met een boekrecensie door Johan van de Wiele (1) waarin we het volgende lazen:\n\nRombout van Kiel, deken van Leuven, was afkomstig uit een welgestelde Mechelse brouwersfamilie. Zowel zijn vader als zijn broer Maarten bekleedden een schepenambt te Mechelen. Rombout was onder andere pastoor van Melsbroek, rector van de Leuvense universiteit, kanunnik van het Sint-Pieterskapittel te Leuven en deken van het landdecanaat Leuven.\n\nPastoor van Melsbroek en rector van de Leuvense universiteit …\nJean-Frédéric Staes (2) heeft eveneens een recensie over datzelfde boek geschreven. We citeren en vinden wat extra informatie:\n\nM. Cloet a choisi le rapport de tournée de Rombout Van Kiel, doyen de Louvain de 1732 à sa mort en 1739. Ancien curé de Melsbroek, président du collège de Malines, chanoine de Saint-Pierre et surtout recteur de l’Université de Louvain en 1727-28 lors du dénouement de l’affaire Van Espen, le visiteur était un ecclésiastique eminent. Le soin extrême avec lequel il s’acquitta de sa tâche en témoigne; son rapport compte parmi les meilleurs du XVIIIe siècle.\n\nHet betreft, logischerwijze, in beide gevallen een recensie over hetzelfde boek, namelijk Het decanaat Leuven in 1732-1734. Visitatieverslag van deken Rombout Van Kiel (3)) van de hand van Michel Cloet.\nHet boek zelf leggen we (voorlopig?) terzijde. Het betreft een visitatieverslag van het decanaat Leuven, onze aandacht gaat eerder naar Melsbroek, zodat het boek grotendeels buiten de focus van deze tekst valt. En in deze uitgave werd het visitatieverslag gepubliceerd in de originele Latijnse versie.\nWel biedt het een aantal aanknopingspunten voor verdere studie."

    "text": "Dorpspastoor in Melsbroek\nWanneer de geschiedenis van Melsbroek ter sprake komt, vallen we in de eerste instantie terug op het standaardwerk van Jos Lauwers. Daarin vinden we inderdaad Rombout (of Rumoldus) Van Kiel terug als dorpspastoor, beginnend bij het overlijden van Glaudius Laurentius van Grasdorf in 1713 (4, pag 262).\nVoetnoten of referenties in de oorspronkelijke tekst van de citaten worden hier tussen vierkante haken weergegeven. Voor een vlotte lezing lopen de nummers van beiden wel door.\n\nNa zijn overlijden werd Pieter Vandersanden gedurende één jaar als deservitor aangesteld, tot bij de benoeming in 1714 van Rumoldus van Kiel, in concursu praepositus [5]. Het Kapittel van St.-Gudula te Brussel koos inderdaad de Mechelaar Rumoldus van Kiel uit als nieuwe dorpsherder, tussen drie kandidaten (pretendit sibi tres in vim concursus nominandos) [5]. In 1715 noteerde de deken: er is een kapelanie van St.-Martinus aan het pastoraat gehecht, op last van 5 missen om de 14 dagen, beschikkende over bijzonder, goede landerijen, waarvan de opbrengst volstaat voor de eraan verbonden lasten. De pastoor bediende zich van het Romeinse officie en droeg in de Winter op zon- en feestdagen de eerste mis op om 7 u., de hoogmis om 10 u.; bij Zomertijd was de eerste mis om 6 u. en de hoogmis om 10 u., waarmee normaal preek of catechese gepaard ging [6]. Onder zijn herderschap werd de in 1627 opgerichte Broederschap van het H. Kruis in 1717 opnieuw georganiseerd, dank zij medehulp van kasteelvrouwe Gisberte de Locquenghien, bij gelegenheid van de ontvangst van de bulle van paus Clemens XI, die rechtstreeks aan de parochie Melsbroek werd toegestuurd. Vanaf 1717 hield hij de registers bij van dopen, huwelijken en overlijdens Vanaf 1720 werd hij kanunnik benoemd van de Collegiale van S.Pieters te Leuven en eredeken van het distrikt Leuven, waar hij trouwens overleed op 11.9.1739.\nZijn opvolger werd Cornelius de Mesmaeker, die op 2 juli 1720 werd aangesteld, maar nog datzelfde jaar op 6 oktober overleed [5]. Nu krijgen we weer een pastoor te Melsbroek, die als voorname persoonlijkheid de geschiedenis zou ingaan. Het was Walter Pluymers uit Wommersom, die in 1721 werd aangesteld, via concursu. Onder zijn herderschap stichtte dorpsvrouwe Gisberte de Locquenghien het Cantuarium van het H. Kruis, waarvoor zij reeds in 1717-20 een kapelaanshuis naast de kerk had doen bouwen.\n\nHierbij echter geen vermelding van enige rol als universiteitsrector. Het is eerder één van de opvolgers, Walter Pluymers, die door Jos Lauwers een voorname persoonlijkheid toegeschreven krijgt.\nIs dit de reden waarom Michel Cloet in een voetnoot verwijst naar Jos Lauwers voor een recente geschiedenis van Melsbroek, maar de informatie over Van Kiel hierin onnauwkeurig noemt? Dit echter zonder nadere verklaring of correctie. Of slaat het op de latere benoemingen in Leuven? Uiteraard staat, in tegenstelling tot het werk van Michel Cloet, Melsbroek en niet het werk en de loopbaan van Rombout Van Kiel, centraal bij Jos Lauwers."

Hij overleed op 54-jarige leeftijd.\nRombout Van Kiel wordt aanzien als een vooraanstaand kerkelijk persoon, waarbij zijn rol in de Van Espen-affaire tijdens zijn rectoraat blijkbaar een belangrijke rol gespeeld heeft. Zeger Bernhard Van Espen nam, op verzoek van de jansenisten in Holland, de verdediging op zich van de jansenist Cornelius Steenoven bij diens consecratie als bisschop van Utrecht, die was gebeurd zonder de goedkeuring van Rome.

So instead of a uniform random distribution of letters, it is now possible to take into account the frequency of these letters as they occur in real life populations.\nSuch population could be the personnel working in a company, eventually extended with other company lists from customers or suppliers involved in a project. Or whatever.\nFor this excercise I use a set of data available from Statbel. Statbel, the Belgian statistical office, collects, produces and disseminates reliable and relevant figures on the Belgian economy, society and territory. And it has data on the occurence of first and family names in Belgium2. I use the 2024 data (status of 2024-01-01). Note that it is not a complete list (only the top 10 000 family names are reported and first names with less than 5 counts are omitted). But it will serve the purpose.\nLet’s start with the first names."

So all Marie, Maria, Monique, … will end up in the M-bin on female side. Marc, Mohamed, Mohammed, Michel, … will be placed in the M-bin on the male side. But as we do not discriminate in our team, we combine both M-bins (and all others) letter-wise.

Another call for looking deeper into the data, even when we are talking about millions of persons. It turns out that some names do not start with capital letters and others carry accents or umlauts. So a procedure to handle these is needed. We replace all “weird” letters by the closest “normal” capitalized letters.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Distribution of starting letters of the first name\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion: not all letters are created equal when it comes to being used as first letters for females, nor males. And the frequency can differ quite a lot between letters. We have also included a vertical red line at 3.85 %, the percentage that would be obtained when all letters were distributed equally over all first names.\n\n\nProbability distribution\nSo now we know how many people carry a first name with a given letter and we can compare the outcome of the team construction question from the previous post with a “real” distribution (as far as we can consider building a team of eight persons starting from the complete Belgian population real of course).\nAs we do not discriminate for our team membership, we merge the datasets for females and males and calculate the (discrete) distribution of first letters over the complete population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Fraction of population vs first name starting letter\n\n\n\n\n\nAs is clear in Figure 2, the distribution is no longer uniform. The dashed horizontal line depicts the fraction of the population with the corresponding first letter of the first name in the case of where all letters would have equal probabality. Not so in reality, with M is a winner, thanks to every Marie, Maria, Martine, Monique, Mohammed, Mohamed, Marc, and all other M*’s in this country.\nIn Figure 3 we show the (discrete) cumulative function. The concept for our simulation is clear: if we now draw a uniformily distributed random number between 0 and 1, say 0.625 (red line), we can see that our team member would have a first name starting with M when taken from the country’s population, instead of Q if all letters would have equal probabilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Cumulative fraction of population vs first name starting letter\n\n\n\n\n\nWe are halfway, we have the means to determine the first letter of our two-letter initials. Let’s now focus on the family names."

    "text": "Generating two-letter initials\nRemember that in the first post we randomly selected the starting letter of the first name from the list of 26 letters. And next randomly selected the starting letter from the family name from the list of the same (duh) 26 letters. Obviously.\nLet’s prepare for a small change that may save us some computational work when dealing later with larger numbers of simulations.\nWe directly take into account the fact that the number of two-letter combinations is in fact not that large, actually 676. And we can use the same approach as before, but now for directly selection the combination of two letters with a single random draw.\nFirst have a look into all possibilities. As in the previous post we could plot the fraction or probability vs the combination of two letters. As the number of different two-letter initials is nevertheless large enough to make it difficult to display as a barchart, we “stretch out” the x-axis and curve it into a circle, glue both ends togetehr at the top and make a lollipop graph on a polar coordinates plot.\nIn Figure 1 the axis starts at the top with AA, AB, AC, …, moving clockwise to end with ZZ back on top. The data are drawn from this circle inwards to the center of the plot, the lollipop bubble showing the actual frequency.\nThe green dashed circle corresponds to the probability of 0.1479 % (i.e. the equal probabilities for all letters case). The grey dotted circles refer to 0.5, 1.0, 1.5 and 2.0 % probabilities. Hence every lollipop ending up in the bull’s eye has certainly a higher probability than 2.0 %.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Frequency of two-letter initials\n\n\n\n\n\nSo a whopping 2.14 % of our population has as initials MV. In contrast to, for example, AS (0.64 %) and GH (0.16 %). But truly rare are the combinations QQ (1.93 ppm), ZX (1.13 ppm), XX (0.32 ppm), QX (0.29 ppm) and UX (0.23 ppm). Or a factor of about 90 000 difference between the most and the least frequent letter combination. This alsp makes the plot a bit crowded and hard to read. If we make a heatmap out of it, color coding the frequency in a matrix of letters, we face the same problem, unless we transform the frequency coding somewhat.\nIn Figure 2 we have taken the log10 of the ratio of the frequency to the smallest frequency observed.\nIt becomes clear that first names and family names with Q, U, X are not that common, surprise. However, also I, Y and Z are quite dark coloured on the family name side and hence are not that common. The brightest intersection can be found at MV and MD, confirming what we already knew. For the less common combinations we now also have a better visualisation of the relative frequencies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Frequency of two-letter initials (as log10(freq/minimum)\n\n\n\n\n\nSo far we didn’t perform a simulation yet, did we? Nope, but it is coming. However, let us have look at the probability distribution in more detail first.\nIn a simulation we will first do exactly the same as in the case with equal probabilities for the letters: eight persons, 1000 redraws and 100 repeats.\nHmm. So we plan again to do 8 x 1000 x 100 = 800000 draws of two letters. We know that we have 676 combinations or bins of all possible letter combinations. So for equal letter probabilities we had on average about 1183 M&M’s in each bin (because of the equal probabilities: 800000/676).\nNow we are facing a situation where these probabilities are not equal anymore. We have way more chance to draw MV (namely 17120 M&M’s in the MV bin) than AS (5120 M&M’s) and certainly more than UX (0.18 M&M, so actually none).\nThis means that for UX with a probability of 2.3 10-7 we find 1 such combination in 4.3 million people. Or about two or three people in the whole population of Belgium of roughly 12 million, and we only plan to 800000 draws… Chances are low that in our simulation we will encounter someone from the Xu, XHrouet, Xhonneux, Xia, … families."

    "text": "The simulation\n\nComparing the methodologies\nLet us anyhow perform the simulation as planned, so that we can compare with the equal probability case.\nWe use essentially the same code as in the previous posts, except for the fact that we use the probability distribution function for the 676 initials and a single random number draw.\nWe now compare the number of persons ending up in the bin corresponding their initials, as obtained in our simulation vs the number that can be calculated from the probability distribution. For the time being, we do so for one experiment only, so drawing 1000 teams of 8 persons. For comparison, each bin would hold 11.83 persons in case of equal probability letters).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Validation plot (on a single experiment)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 3 we plotted a sort of “validation plot”. If the number in each bin would be exacly the same when counted during the simulation and when calculated from the probability distribution function one would have all data point on the green diagonal (with intercept equal to zero, and a unity slope).\nWhile all point gravitate around this line as expected, the graph also shows the distribution of the initial. A few with high probability and quite a lot lumped in the lower left corner.\nFitting a straight line through all data points yield an intercept of -0.0293095 and a slope of 1.0024767. Both in apparently reasonable agreement with our expectations.\nIt is tempting to attribute the deviations to the random nature of our simulations. This is the case, but also have a more detailed look into the dot cloud in the lower left corner (the black rectangle in the insert in Figure 4).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Validation plot detail (a single experiment)\n\n\n\n\n\nIf we calculate the number of persons in a specific bin from the probability we end up with decimal numbers. We feel more comfortable with counting the persons from the simulation, then we have at least complete persons in each bin …\nThis of course has some influence on the fitting results, but especially notice something else. If we look at the simulation bins with, say, five persons added, we notice that they cover quite a range of bins (roughly from two to eleven) on the probability side. So if we would expect two persons based on probability, we can get five. But also if we would expect to encounter eleven persons. Quite a lot of other combinations exist of course, due to the random nature. That is not the problem. But how can we express the accuracy of the simulation and does this, well quite large deviations change with the number of expeced people (or the probability distribution)?\nLet’s plot the differences between the number of persons simulated and expected (based on probability theory) vs the expected number.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Comparing differences between methodologies (single experiment)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe see that for the higher expected number the relative difference (expressed as (number(simulation)-number(probability))/number(probability))) approaches zero, as expected when both numbers are equal. On the other hand for lower numbers, meaning a lower probability of occurence of the corresponding initials, that we see more deviation. Some, where the number of simulation equals zero, the relative difference becomes minus one, and in other cases the simulation apparently large overestimate the outcome. Well, when dealing with smaller numbers one or two extra of course make a large difference.\nIs this due to the fact that we only show the results of one experiment, or is this indeed an example of wat we can name a rare event bias?\n\n\nExploring the full experiment\nWhen we would plot the data for 100 experiments as in Figure 3, it would be a pretty messy and hard to read graph. Therefore we calculate the average number of persons in each bin over the 100 experiments, and at the same time we calculate the standard deviation as well.\nWe ran 100 experiments, so in fact we have a dataframe of 676 x 100 elements. Not that much, so we can store it directly. We could also use incremental calculation formula for mean and standard deviation if the number of experiments would become larger.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Comparing differences between methodologies (100 simulations)\n\n\n\n\n\nNow comparing Figure 6 (for the average of 100 experiments) to Figure 3 (for a single experiment, well, it looks muuuch better. But how about the differences? As we calculated a mean for each bin, we can also calculate the standard deviations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Comparing standard deviations vs average numbers (100 simulations)\n\n\n\n\n\nWe know that the average of our simulation experiments is a good estimator for the probability theory. The variance of this estimator provides an absolute measure of how widely distributed it is around its mean value. A measure of relative variation of the MC estimator is often more useful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Comparing relative standard deviations vs average numbers (100 simulations)\n\n\n\n\n\nWell, let’s reflect on this somewhat by recapitulating.\nThere are 676 bins, or gates. Each gate is identified by a two letter code. We take the Belgian population and they are assigned a two letter code by taking the first letter of the first name and from the family name. Then we randomly pick people, taken into account that some two letter combinations occur more frequently than others. In one experiment we do this 1000 times for 8 people, and they are send through the gate carrying their initials, and counted. And the counts are noted for each bin.\nThen we do this 99 more times, and we average the counts for each bin for the set of 100 experiments. And we calculate the (relative) standard deviation so that we end up with Figure 8.\nWe can do nothing else than observe that the relative standard deviations for the gates with low counts (aka people with less common initials) are huge. Would it be fair to conclude that for rare events we can expect very large uncertainties in the outcome of our simulation? And can we generalise this (for instance in the simulation of a pandemic outbreak in an early stage)?\nIn this case the conclusion is surely affected by the probability distribution function of the initials. But we made an average of 100 experiments of 1000 runs. What if we did the opposite: taking averages of 1000 experiments of 100 runs? In both case we have 10000 draws of teams. Or why make the difference even? Let’s take teams of eight people and see how the results evolve with the number of draws whatsoever. Can we run our simulation to a predefined precision?\nValid questions for another post, and another setting."

Het voltallige Flamac personeel had op die dag de organisatie verlaten. De meesten zochten nieuwe horizonten op, ontevreden met de gang van zaken en de wijze waarop Flamac geleid werd en hoe dit de toekomst van de organisatie en hun persoonlijke loopbaan compromiteerde. Sommigen werd gevraagd om op te stappen, in een poging om operationele kosten te besparen. Het grootste kapitaal van de organisatie, van elk bedrijf, liep evenvoudigweg weg.\nDe innovatieve geest, de creativiteit en de “Flamac Way” bij het omgaan met zowel klantprojecten als fundamentele onderzoeksprojecten bij het bewijzen van de voordelen van high-throughput screening in een groot aantal toepassingen zijn niet verloren gegaan. Dit alles blijft voorbestaan doordat al het Flamac-personeel nieuwe uitdagingen heeft gevonden en de geest van Flamac heeft verspreid, waardoor de zaden ervan nu in een veelheid aan bedrijven zijn geplant.\nIn november 2023 was vrijwel alle apparatuur verkocht en waren de Flamac-labs leeg. Een groot deel van de operationele kosten, de personeelskosten, zijn letterlijk naar nul gedaald. Blijkbaar was deze kostenbesparing niet de weg naar een duurzame toekomst… Dat is het ook nooit."

Maar er is wel iets raars met de uitspraak, vind ik. In zoverre dat men zich de vraag kan stellen wat Melsbroek nu eigenlijk wel betekent.\nOp zich een vrij bizarre vraag, we kijken in het meest recente werk terzake, De Vlaamse gemeentenamen. Verklarend woordenboek: Tweede, grondig herziene en vermeerderde uitgave (2022) (1), en we weten het dan wel.\nBladzijde 166 lezen we Melsbroek is een samenstelling op broek, waarvan het eerste deel afgeleid kan zijn van Germaans militha ‘honing(kleurig)’ of van de kruidnaam melde, zoals in Melsele. De s in Melsbroek is wellicht ingevoegd ter wille van de welluidendheid. En er wordt toegevoegd dat men in het lokale dialect [’mailzbruk] zegt, met [ai].\nUiteraard is die uitleg niet helemaal nieuw. Het standaardwerk van de Melsbroekse geschiedenis heet niet voor niets Melsbroek, waar de melde bloeit in ’t broek (2). En over het honingkleurig moeras leerden we al in de lessen Nederlands in de jaren ’70.\nMaar vermits er staat afgeleid kan zijn en wellicht ingevoegd besluit ik dat ze het eigenlijk ook niet weten. Op zich geen schande, het staat nergens opgeschreven wie en wanneer Melsbroek zo genoemd heeft, en we waren er zelf ook niet bij toen dat beslist werd. En wie zegt dat broek hier wel moeras betekent? Het zou voor de hand liggend zijn, maar misschien is er een andere verklaring?"

Dan zijn Perk en Wambeek al wat simpeler…\nMaar er is wel een eigenaardigheid in die zin dat er een aantal andere dorpjes in de buurt met dezelfde medeklinker-klinker-combinatie beginnen. Namelijk Machelen en Mechelen. In Machelen is de “a” een “a”, en in Mechelen is de “e” een “e”, In Melsbroek staat de “e” dichter bij de “a” dan bij een “e”. En klinkt ook niet als de “mi” in “mi-litha” en de “me” in “melde”.\nNu, een alien zal aanbrengen dat er wel meer rare dingen in Melsbroek zijn. Maar toch, zou de naamgeving in het dialect anno 2025 nog een verwijzing kunnen bevatten naar een naamgeving van honderden jaren, of zelfs anderhalf millenium, terug?\nEen mogelijke verklaring die het Vlaams woordenboek niet gehaald heeft, is dat Melsbroek volgens Gramaye klinkt als het moeras van Melchior, Melchior’s broek (3). Kunnen we dan niet eerder van Maël’s broek spreken, dat sluit beter aan bij de uitspraak. Alleen: hoe klonk de spraak van een Melsbroekenaar toen de naam aan deze plek gegeven werd? En wie is dan Melchior, of Maël(le)? En waarom zou men een moeras naar een persoon noemen? Welke waarde heeft een moeras om het naar de eigenaar te vernoemen? Of naar een (ruigte)plant? Lijkt ook raar.\nEr wordt ook niet gerept over een discussie rond een mysterieuze plaats in het leven van de Heilige Pirminius: Melcis Castellum. Melsbroek is één van de plaatsen die naar voor geschoven werd. En waar Lauwers in zijn later werk (2) de melde-hypothese volgt, was hij eerder overtuigd van de Melcis Castellum route (4). De vraag die hierbij steeds naar boven komt is: Was Melcis Castellum het huidige Melsbroek? en niet Wat betekent Melcis Castellum? Zou het kunnen dat met het aanreiken van puzzelstukken rond Melcis Castellum meteen ook een verklaring voor de naam én het verband met Melsbroek duidelijk kan worden?\nOf blijft alles giswerk tot er nog ergens primaire bronnen opduiken, voor zover die (nog) bestaan?\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpmerking\n\n\n\nWordt vervolgd onder Stories."

This stochastic description is the basis for three methods we describe here to numerically solve the kinetic master equation for chemically activated unimolecular reactions.\nThe first method allows the calculation of the complete time evolution within a given mechanism, and is based an Gillespie’s exact stochastic method (ESM). It is essentially a Monte Carlo simulation of the stochastic reaction processes,\nThe second method allows for the direct calculation of the steady-state product distribution (DCPD), it describes the random walk within the framework of a discrete time Markov chain, and reduces the calculation of the steady-state product distribution to a fairly simple matrix algebra problem,\nThe third method calculates the steady-state population of the intermediates (CSSPI), reformulating the solution of the master equation as an eigenvector problem generated by the description as a continuous time Markov chain,\nTo our knowledge, the DCPD method has not been described before. Also, this is the first time that a CSSPI model is used explicitly in this type of calculation, The three methods are illustrated using the simple H+HNCO reaction, important in the RAPRENOx mechanism for NOx removal from flue gases.\n\n\nAuthor and article information\nStochastic simulation of chemically activated unimolecular reactions Luc Vereecken, Guido Huyberechts, Jozef Peeters Journal of Chemical Physics 106, 6564–6573 (1997)\nhttps://doi.org/10.1063/1.473656\n\n\nComments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWork in progress."

Ancien curé de Melsbroek, président du collège de Malines, chanoine de Saint-Pierre et surtout recteur de l’Université de Louvain en 1727-28 lors du dénouement de l’affaire Van Espen, le visiteur était un ecclésiastique eminent.

    "text": "Melsbroek\nWanneer de geschiedenis van Melsbroek ter sprake komt, vallen we in de eerste instantie terug op het standaardwerk van Jos Lauwers. Daarin vinden we inderdaad Rombout (of Rumoldus) Van Kiel terug als dorpspastoor, beginnend bij het overlijden van Glaudius Laurentius van Grasdorf in 1713 (4, pag 262).\nVoetnoten of referenties in de oorspronkelijke tekst van de citaten worden hier tussen vierkante haken weergegeven. Voor een vlotte lezing lopen de nummers van beiden wel door.\n\nNa zijn overlijden werd Pieter Vandersanden gedurende één jaar als deservitor aangesteld, tot bij de benoeming in 1714 van Rumoldus van Kiel, in concursu praepositus [5]. Het Kapittel van St.-Gudula te Brussel koos inderdaad de Mechelaar Rumoldus van Kiel uit als nieuwe dorpsherder, tussen drie kandidaten (pretendit sibi tres in vim concursus nominandos) [5]. In 1715 noteerde de deken: er is een kapelanie van St.-Martinus aan het pastoraat gehecht, op last van 5 missen om de 14 dagen, beschikkende over bijzonder, goede landerijen, waarvan de opbrengst volstaat voor de eraan verbonden lasten. De pastoor bediende zich van het Romeinse officie en droeg in de Winter op zon- en feestdagen de eerste mis op om 7 u., de hoogmis om 10 u.; bij Zomertijd was de eerste mis om 6 u. en de hoogmis om 10 u., waarmee normaal preek of catechese gepaard ging [6]. Onder zijn herderschap werd de in 1627 opgerichte Broederschap van het H. Kruis in 1717 opnieuw georganiseerd, dank zij medehulp van kasteelvrouwe Gisberte de Locquenghien, bij gelegenheid van de ontvangst van de bulle van paus Clemens XI, die rechtstreeks aan de parochie Melsbroek werd toegestuurd. Vanaf 1717 hield hij de registers bij van dopen, huwelijken en overlijdens Vanaf 1720 werd hij kanunnik benoemd van de Collegiale van S.Pieters te Leuven en eredeken van het distrikt Leuven, waar hij trouwens overleed op 11.9.1739.\nZijn opvolger werd Cornelius de Mesmaeker, die op 2 juli 1720 werd aangesteld, maar nog datzelfde jaar op 6 oktober overleed [5]. Nu krijgen we weer een pastoor te Melsbroek, die als voorname persoonlijkheid de geschiedenis zou ingaan. Het was Walter Pluymers uit Wommersom, die in 1721 werd aangesteld, via concursu. Onder zijn herderschap stichtte dorpsvrouwe Gisberte de Locquenghien het Cantuarium van het H. Kruis, waarvoor zij reeds in 1717-20 een kapelaanshuis naast de kerk had doen bouwen.\n\nHierbij echter geen vermelding van enige rol als universiteitsrector. Het is eerder één van de opvolgers, Walter Pluymers, die door Jos Lauwers een voorname persoonlijkheid toegeschreven krijgt.\nIs dit de reden waarom Michel Cloet in een voetnoot verwijst naar Jos Lauwers voor een recente geschiedenis van Melsbroek, maar de informatie over Van Kiel hierin onnauwkeurig noemt? Dit echter zonder nadere verklaring of correctie. Of slaat het op de latere benoemingen in Leuven? Uiteraard staat, in tegenstelling tot het werk van Michel Cloet, Melsbroek en niet het werk en de loopbaan van Rombout Van Kiel, centraal bij Jos Lauwers."

Rombout Van Kiel was op dat moment president van het Mechels College in Leuven.\nWe vinden hier de bevestiging dat Romout Van Kiel leesmeester geweest is in Scherpenheuvel en daarna pastoor van Melsbroek bij Vilvoorde, landdeken van hetdistrict Mechelen, president van het Mechels college. In 1728 verlaat hij dit Mechels college. Er wordt hier geen reden en geen olgende stap gegeven.\nMerk op dat volgens deze bron (uit 1775) Romuldus Van Kiel in 1739 niet in Leuven overleden is, maar wel binnen Mechelen, namelijk in het huis van zijn broer, de brouwerij de Lelie in de Befferstraat naast de Befferbrug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHet is in ieder geval (zie Figuur 2) zo dat Rombout Van Kiel met het nodige eerbetoon in Mechelen begraven werd op 13 september 1739.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFiguur 2: Begrafenisakte van Rumoldus Van Kiel"

I missed the ones in Cambridge (1987), Enschede (1988), Montreux (1989) and Karlsruhe (1990). So be it. But in 1991: Rome.\nLater on, I attended San Sebastian (1992), Budapest (1993), Toulouse (1994), Stockholm (1995) and Leuven (1996). The latter, Eurosensors X, was some sort of home match. Sort of as I tried to convince the imec management (my employer at the time) to candidate for the organisation of the tenth conference. In vain, but the colleaugues of KU Leuven got the honour and a role in the local organisation committee was our task.\nThat was the last Eurosensors conference I attended. I missed Warsaw, Southampton, The Hague while still on imec’s paylist and all others due to divergent professional paths. At the time of this writing Eurosensors XXXVI in Debrecen closed some three months ago.\nBack to Rome."

    "text": "Welcome\nEvery international conference has about the same structure. Registration, plenary keynote speeches, oral presentations, a poster session and a social part: welcome reception, conference dinner, a cultural event, etc. But before the scientific part starts, there are welcome messages from the organisers, the hosting university or organisation, representatives of the local authorities…\nThe welcome address (and plenary lectures if I remember well) was held in a beautiful wooden auditorium, creaking under every step, at the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas. Father Giordano addressed his guests, as announced, in the true language of science. I am not sure whether I was the only one in the audience having hard times to understand the speech. But no problem, the organising committee anounced that we would receive a handout of the speech.\nRecently, while cleaning out some drawers, I stumbled into that document again. I gladly share the inspiring text 1 below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nP. Augustinus Giordano\nConventus Universitatis Prior\nIllis qui in congressu Eurosensors V intersunt\nsalutem nuntiat\n\nSalutem plurimam nuntio, P. Rectoris, P. Josephi Fernandez Castaño, et meam omnibus vobis qui, apud Universitatem nostram in hoc congressu interestis ut fructus laboris vestri, optime ad scientiam pertinentis, inter vos communicetis.\nQuod vos hospitio accepimus magnificentissimo non tantum Universitatis nostrae aedificia vobis suppedidat, sed etiam, et ante omnia, dignationem, admirationem et communionem nostram laboribus vestris atque inventis vult significare.\nMinime labor vester a nobis alienus est et hoc duplici ostenditur modo: quod attinet ad investigationes vestras et vestram relationem ad Deum et quod attinet ad vosmet ipsos studio deditos et rationem vestram ad hominem.\n\nVirium inter se compositarum copia, quae in rerum natura extat, corrupta esset nisi homines in varios usus illas adhibuissent. Ceterum, minime homunibus decorum fuisset, si ipsis omnia ad nutum, sine investigationibus sollicitudine et inventionis gaudio, praesto fuissent.\nScimus usum illorum qui sensores vocantur, contendere, multiplici- bus rationibus, homanas cogitationes et ipsam singulorum vitae meliores efficere. Qua de re quidquid novis inventis praebitis, id participatio in opera Dei Creatoris fit, qui potestatem terram gubernandi hominibus dedit et, eodem tempore, scientia vestra praecipua claritate induitur.\nDe Sapientia enim scriptum est:\n\n\nCandor est enim lucis aeternae\net speculum sine macula Dei potentiae\net imago bonitatis illius (Sap. 7,26).\n\nPraeterea, ut ait S. Thomas Aquinas, omnes veritates cum Prima Veritate rationem habent.\nSic omnes sunt verae una prima veritate, cui inumquodque assimilatur secundum suam entitatem. Et sic, licet plures sint essentiae vel formae rerum, tamen una est veritas divini intellectus, secundum quam omnes res denominantur verae (S. Thomas, I, q.16, a.6 co).\nSic stantibus rebus, studia vestra et vester nuntius ad scientiam pertinens fines intrat Sacrorum et, quodammodo, Divini, ut affirmat Constitutio “Gaudium et spes”: Qui umili et constanti animo abscondita rerum perscrutari conatur, etsi inscius quasi manu Dei ducitur qui, res omnes sustinens, facit ut sint id quod sunt (n. 36).\nUno tempore, hominibus praebetis, ipsa Dei ratione, veritatem nuda et sincera persuasionis vi praeditam, sicut pro certo Ecclesia statuit: Nec aliter veritatem sese imponere nisi vi ipsius veritatis, quae suaviter simul ac fortiter mentibus illabitur (Dignitatis humanae, 1).\n\nIn ratione ad hominem, cum fructus laborum vestrorum proponatis, nos non posse proficere declaratis, etiam in humana ratione, sine approbatione inventorum qui in studiorum investigatione laborant. Nam, quod vobis clarum est atque evidens, id, plerisque hominibus, arcanum manet, et tamen veneratione et grata beneficii memoria probatur.\nCongressus vester hunc duplicem aspectum ostendit, evidentiae et arcani. Scientiae evidentia in vobis inest; indoctis autem evidentiae egesta humana fide vestrarum investigationum severitati suppletur.\nSensores enim res minime intelligibiles humanis sensibus ostendumt.\nEt ipsi tamen coram veritatibus, quae rerum naturae terminos excedunt, nihil valent. Aliae res enim vigent nullo modo prorsus intelligibiles nachinis vel egregiis, sed quae cor promptum atque expeditum ex parte hominum exigunt, id est exigunt fidem quae naturae modum omnino superat.\nHumana gens summam fidem habet vobis, qui viam et rationem et fidem reseratis veritatibus quae omnem intelligendi vim devincunt.\n\nAudeo tanden hortatum addere officii plenum. Cor vestrum et vestra intelligendi prudentia, quae omnes sensores exsuperant, perveniant ad cognitionem Illius qui benigne se aperit omnibus qui eum ex animo et toto pectore quaerunt.\nHac mente et hac dignatione omnibus vobis dico: Bene manete in nostra Universitate optimeque in opere sitis."

Impossible to remember (or even attend them all).\nI do remember however a keynote lecture on integration of neurons on silicon chips. I don’t exactly remember the speaker’s name, probably affiliated to a Texan univeristy if I recall well. I will update if I find the reference.\nWhat I do remember is that I suggested to start similar research when back home. All in vain, such things were not within the scope of the organisation. And what would be the benefit? Well, some 20-25 years later the proposal to build a human brain-on-chip model is a decent research field, also at the same organisation…\nMore down to earth, some advice: when at a conference social event (museum visit combined with a showcase of Italian food) always have something to drink at hand, especially when you are offered a quite big chunk of parmegiano. It could be literally breath taking."
