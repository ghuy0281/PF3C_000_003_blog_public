    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nWhen I wander around the internet, there are several places where I tend to linger a little longer. One of them is the blog of Antoine Soetewey (“AS”): Stats and R1. This time my attention was drawn by the post of 2023-12-06, about the probability of two people in a meeting or team having the same initials2.\nThis is the introduction of the “problem”, in Antoine’s words:\n\nLast week, I joined a team to work on a collaborative project. The team was already established for a few months, with several scientists working together on the project. For simplicity, they used to sign documents, mention colleagues in emails, etc. with their initials (the first letter of their first name followed by the first letter of their last name).\n\nA couple of days after joining the project, when I needed to sign my first document with my initials, we realized that another person in the team had the exact same initials than me. This was not really an issue, as we decided that I would write my initials backward, that is, “SA” instead of “AS”, and the other person would keep signing with “AS” as usual.\n\nIt could have stopped here. However, the idea to write a post about this rather trivial anecdote came to me when the team leader claimed, in the middle of a meeting: “That’s very unfortunate that you two have the same initials! What are the chances of this happening to us?!”. We spent a couple of minutes trying to estimate this probability, which in the end were mostly based on our intuitions rather than on a formal calculation. This piqued my curiosity.\n\nAnd my curiosity as well … for several reasons:\n\nWhen signing documents, pages, and e-mails, can one not just use unique digital signatures these days? But that spoils the question of course.\nWhen using paper and pen for writing, are the initials in written form (paraph) not sufficiently different? Maybe fine for old-school legal documents and signoff lists, but in daily e-mails and meeting minutes? Nah.\nWhy not use four characters? Actually, that is the origin of this blog’s name. The abbreviation for my name as it was used in a company. We also used that system for minutes of meetings with externals. A meeting with Antoine would then have ASOE and GHUY after the names in the attendance list, in the abbreviation of names mentioned in the text and in the action list for instance.\nOr go the full way: as-8bf24bec-4dc9-4989-8132-7dcbe1476e68\n\nThe latter, combining the initials with a unique UUID (or GUID)3, is certainly the best regarding uniqueness. A bit hard to memorise… The UUID is generated by an R package4 as an exercise.\n\nGiven that the project we are working on requires the use of simulations, I decided to focus on answering this question via simulations in R. That being said, as for most simulations, it is a good practice to verify these results. This is done using probability theory. This comparison will allow to assess the truthfulness of results obtained through simulations.\n\nFurthermore, I thought that it would be a nice way to illustrate methods not often presented in my posts: for loops, replications and writing functions in R.\n\n\nI would like to reflect somewhat more on this problem, but I do not intend to copy his whole blog page, so please look at Antoine’s original post for details first."

    "text": "Reflections on the results\nWelcome back…\nLet’s summarize the conditions and results.\n\nAS starts, for his team of eight persons, by creating a vector of size eight, corresponding to the initials of each of the team members.\n\nIt is checked whether there are duplicate initials.\n\nIt is estimated, via simulations, how likely it is that at least two persons have the same initials among the team. So the vector of eight sampled initials is replicated (or rather re-drawn) a large number of times, namely 1000 times.\n\nA matrix of eight rows and 1000 columns is the result. Each row corresponds to the sampled initials of a person, and each column corresponds to one simulated team of 8 people. It remains to compute how many of these 1000 teams have at least two persons with the same initials. Under the given conditions it was 41. It can be stated that the probability of having duplicate initials is 4.1 %.\nAs the construction of the teams is a random process, this probability will vary each time a simulation is run. In the end, 100 simulations were carried out and returned a list of 100 probabilities. AS shows a histogram and a boxplot to demonstrate that the probability that at least two persons share the same initials among a team of 8 people is most likely between 3.5% and 4.5%.\nWe could use his data, with permission, to calculate the mean as well.\n\n# ==============================================================================\n# Calculate mean and standard deviation for AS' 100 replicate data\n#\nd_as &lt;- c(0.032, 0.037, 0.040, 0.043, 0.033, 0.042, 0.039, 0.047, 0.045, 0.038, 0.052, 0.042,\n          0.042, 0.040, 0.023, 0.044, 0.041, 0.039, 0.036, 0.048, 0.041, 0.037, 0.027, 0.030,\n          0.052, 0.038, 0.043, 0.035, 0.038, 0.045, 0.047, 0.044, 0.030, 0.036, 0.036, 0.048,\n          0.038, 0.045, 0.044, 0.034, 0.031, 0.043, 0.045, 0.034, 0.049, 0.047, 0.051, 0.036,\n          0.051, 0.040, 0.043, 0.044, 0.038, 0.049, 0.043, 0.050, 0.035, 0.043, 0.048, 0.038,\n          0.041, 0.044, 0.039, 0.045, 0.033, 0.057, 0.036, 0.043, 0.041, 0.041, 0.041, 0.041,\n          0.038, 0.044, 0.031, 0.034, 0.049, 0.041, 0.040, 0.034, 0.032, 0.036, 0.049, 0.047,\n          0.048, 0.038, 0.038, 0.037, 0.036, 0.037, 0.043, 0.040, 0.026, 0.049, 0.046, 0.044,\n          0.048, 0.038, 0.026, 0.029)\nn_as &lt;- length(d_as)\nm_as &lt;- mean(d_as)\ns_as &lt;- sd(d_as)\n#\n\nBased on the data, a mean of 4.05 % is observed, with a standard deviation of 0.65 %.\nIt is possible to compare this result obtained through simulations with results obtained from probability theory. In fact, AS reports that the number of possible two-letter initials (TLI) in the case of a team of 8 persons is 4.07218 %.\nOf course this brings up an obvious question: why simulate and come to variable results (due to the random nature) if one can calculate the exact result from probability theory? For me at least, a satisfying answer is that we can prove that the same result can be obtained, giving confidence to the simulation method under conditions where the result could not be calculated analytically in a convenient way, or not at all.\nBut also other questions arise. Is the result close enough to the true value? What is the effect of the number of re-draws?\nFurthermore, the two-letter initials are generated by random selection of a first initial and random selection of a second initial, both from the list of 26 characters of the Latin alphabet. It is mentioned by AS that “all letters of the alphabet had the same probability of occurring, meaning that all pairs of initials were equally probable. This is probably not the case in reality, as a first and last name starting both with X is not as probable as a first and last name starting respectively with M and K.” Now this also makes a nice case and in fact makes the whole question, or better the solution, pretty region dependent. Imagine for instance parts of the world where a lot of people have names like Kim, Nguyen, etc.\nAnd when we go from two-letter to four-letter initials, we need the actual family names, as a random selection of three characters is not really realistic in real life. Well, not sure what the future brings (considering names like X Æ A-Xii). Well, some mothers (and fathers) do have them, as they used to say. And in areas with frequently occuring family names, it remains a problem of course.\nAs AS states: this bias could be limited by specifying different weights when sampling initials."

    "text": "Variation on a theme\n\nSetting the scene\nWell, we differ somewhat in taste. Probably because I am more of an experimenter and not really a mathematician nor statistician, but repeats and replicates could be better defined in my opinion. With replicates experimenters (in chemical analysis for instance) point to the execution of a lab experiment/analysis under exact the same conditions. In the case of a simulation experiment this would correspond to the use of the same sequence of random numbers. This will then also give exactly the same result. So repeats, with different random numbers, are to be considered.\nTo avoid confusion, and for the purpose of this post, I will consider the random selection of two-letter initials as drawing M&M-like5 candies from a huge6 bag containing candies with all possible combinations of two letters printed on them. Obviously: I call the determination of one random two-letter initial a draw of a two-letter initial. In the same context I call the draw of a team the drawing (with putting back after each two-letter initial) of eight M&M’s. I have a number of repeats, in order to allow the determination of the probability of having duplicate two-letter initials and the number of experiments to indicate how many times the number of repeats is carried out. Recall that, in our definitions, AS used 1000 as number of repeats and 100 as number of experiments.\n\n\nAdapting the code to my taste\nI will further explore some aspects of the same type of simulation. So let’s start with a variation on the theme. At first, the letters are randomly sampled among all 26 letters of the Latin alphabet. The code below does essentially the same as in the Stats and R blog, apart from minor changes, reflecting personal taste and the use of code chunks in a Quarto, an open-source scientific and technical publishing system7 and the preference for a long data format (working with one team (= one observation) per row)8.\n\n# ==============================================================================\n# Simulation, following the method of AS\n# ==============================================================================\n# FUNCTIONS\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\ncmps_team_as &lt;- function(n_persons) {\n#\n# Draw a team: compose a team of n_persons, the AS way. \n# Dataframe df contains one row with n_persons two-letter initials, AS style, \n# and the last column is the percentage of unique initials in this team \n# composition.\n#\n  df &lt;-replicate(n_persons, \n                 paste0(sample(LETTERS, size = 1), \n                        sample(LETTERS, size = 1)))\n  df &lt;-  as.data.frame(t(df))\n  df$count &lt;- apply(df,1,function(x) sum(!duplicated(x)))\n  df$count &lt;- 100*df$count/n_persons\n  return(df)\n}\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#\n# Set the number of persons in a team and the number of teams to be composed \n# (= number of repeats)\n#\nn_persons &lt;- 8     # number of persons per team [AS: 8]\nn_teams &lt;- 1000    # number of repeats (teams)  [AS: 1000]\nn_exper &lt;- 100     # number of experiments      [AS:  100]\n#\nd_as &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(data=NA, ncol=2, nrow=n_exper))\n#\nrepro &lt;- FALSE  # set TRUE for reproducible random numbers\n#\n# Filename for file to accept team compositions, delete first\n# if old file exists\n#\nfl &lt;- \"exp_results.csv\"\nif (file.exists(fl)) {\n  file.remove(fl)\n  fate &lt;- \"File deleted\"\n} else {\n  fate &lt;- \"No file found\"\n}\n#\nfor (xp in 1:n_exper) {\n#\n# Set a seed and compose the first team\n#\nzaad &lt;- xp\n#\nif (repro == TRUE) {\n  set.seed(zaad)\n}\nelse\n{\n a=as.numeric(Sys.time())\n set.seed(a)\n}\n#\nteams &lt;- cmps_team_as(n_persons)\n#\n# Fill up the teams dataframe with the remaining teams\n#\nfor (i in 2:n_teams) { \n   team &lt;- cmps_team_as(n_persons)\n   teams &lt;- rbind(teams, team)\n}\n#\ncnt_unique &lt;- length(which(teams$count==100))\npct_multip &lt;- 100*(1-cnt_unique/n_teams)\n#\n# Use write.table to append teams to the file\n# (as write.csv overwrites even with append=TRUE (?)\n#\nwrite.table(teams, file=fl, append = TRUE, row.names=FALSE, , sep=',')\n#\nd_as[xp, 1] &lt;- fl\nd_as[xp, 2] &lt;- pct_multip\n}\n#\nn_as &lt;- length(d_as)\nm_as &lt;- mean(d_as[,2])\ns_as &lt;- sd(d_as[,2])\nrsd_as &lt;- 100*s_as/m_as\n\nBased on the data, a mean of 4.08 % is observed, with a standard deviation of 0.64 %. Which is pretty much the same result as AS in his original post.\nOne further modification is needed if I want to use a different probability profile for the letters. I made some changes to the code but kept it such that a uniform letter probability can still be used as before, as a validation tool as well.\n\n# ==============================================================================\n# Simulation, allowing non-uniform distribution of letters\n# ==============================================================================\n# FUNCTIONS\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------#\ncmps_team_gh &lt;- function(n_persons, df_p) {\n#\n# Draw a team: compose a team of n_persons, the GH way. \n# Supply a dataframe with probabilities for all letters in df_p\n# Output dataframe df contains one row with n_persons two-letter initials, \n# and the last column is the percentage of unique initials in this team \n# composition.\n#\n  team &lt;- replicate(n_persons, NA)\n  for (i in 1:n_persons) { \n# \n# Draw the first initial, then the second and add to the team\n# \n    urn &lt;- runif(2)\n    check &lt;- which(with(df_p, df_p$low &lt;= urn[1] & df_p$high &gt; urn[1]))\n    lttr &lt;- df_p$lttr[check]\n    check &lt;- which(with(df_p, df_p$low &lt;= urn[2] & df_p$high &gt; urn[2]))\n    lttr &lt;- paste0(lttr, df_p$lttr[check])\n    team[i] &lt;- lttr\n    }\n#\n  df &lt;- team\n  df &lt;-  as.data.frame(t(df))\n  df$count &lt;- apply(df,1,function(x) sum(!duplicated(x)))\n  df$count &lt;- 100*df$count/n_persons\n  return(df)\n}\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#\n# Define the probability distribution function\n#\n# All letters have equal probability of occurence in this case\n#\ndf_p &lt;- data.frame(lttr = LETTERS, prob = replicate(26, 1/26))\n#\n# Prepare to pass on to random draw\n#\ncolnames(df_p) &lt;- c('lttr', 'low')\ndf_p$high &lt;- df_p$low\n#\ndf_p[1,2] &lt;- 0.00\ndf_p[26,3] &lt;- 1.00\n#\nfor (i in 2:26) { \n  j &lt;- i-1\n  df_p[i,3] &lt;- df_p[j,3]+df_p[i,2]\n  df_p[i,2] &lt;- df_p[j,3]\n}\n#\n# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n#\n# Set the number of persons in a team and the number of teams to be composed \n# (= number of repeats)\n#\nn_persons &lt;- 8     # number of persons per team [AS: 8]\nn_teams &lt;- 1000    # number of repeats (teams)  [AS: 1000]\nn_exper &lt;-100      # number of experiments      [AS:  100]\n#\nd_gh &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(data=NA, ncol=2, nrow=n_exper))\n#\nrepro &lt;- FALSE  # set TRUE for reproducible random numbers\n#\nfor (xp in 1:n_exper) {\n#\n# Set a seed and compose the first team\n#\nzaad &lt;- xp\n#\nif (repro == TRUE) {\n  set.seed(zaad)\n}\nelse\n{\n a=as.numeric(Sys.time())\n set.seed(a)\n}\nteams &lt;- cmps_team_gh(n_persons, df_p)\n#\n# Fill up the teams dataframe with the remaining teams\n#   \nfor (i in 2:n_teams) { \n   team &lt;- cmps_team_gh(n_persons, df_p)\n   teams &lt;- rbind(teams, team)\n}\n#\ncnt_unique &lt;- length(which(teams$count==100))\npct_multip &lt;- 100*(1-cnt_unique/n_teams)\n#\n# Uncomment for writing csv data files per experiment\n#\nflx &lt;- paste0('exp_', formatC(xp, width=4, flag=\"0\"))\n#\nd_gh[xp, 1] &lt;- flx\nd_gh[xp, 2] &lt;- pct_multip\n}\n#\nn_gh &lt;- length(d_gh)\nm_gh &lt;- mean(d_gh[,2])\ns_gh &lt;- sd(d_gh[,2])\nrsd_gh &lt;- 100*s_gh/m_gh\n\nBased on the data from this modified code, a mean of 4.18 % is observed, with a standard deviation of 0.61 %. Again, taking into account the random nature of the process, pretty much the same result as AS.\nThe results can be compared in the following boxplot. The blue boxes have their usual meanings in the geom_boxplot context. The lower and upper hinges correspond to the first and third quartiles (the 25th and 75th percentiles). The upper whisker extends from the hinge to the largest value no further than 1.5 * IQR from the hinge (where IQR is the inter-quartile range, or distance between the first and third quartiles). The lower whisker extends from the hinge to the smallest value at most 1.5 * IQR of the hinge. I added the mean (red dot) as well, The green horizontal line corresponds to the actual probabilistic outcome.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Comparative boxplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReflections\nThe results are quite similar, re-running the simulations with different random numbers will change the results somewhat. However the general conclusion about the magnitude of the probability of having duplicate two-letter initials remains valid.\nFor the current purpose, having a rough idea about the probability of duplicate two-letter initials in teams of eight people, this may suffice.\nWhat strikes me however is the pretty large Relative Standard Deviation (aka Coefficient of Variation). In this set of experiments we find 15.7% and 14.6% for the AS and GH case respectively. Note that the result is indeed random. Sometimes the first case (AS) gives a smaller Relative Standard Deviation, sometimes the second (GH).\nThe Relative Standard Deviation is however higher than I expected. After all, we ran quite some simulations. This raises questions on how the mean and standard deviation depend on the choices of the parameters. Something to explore later.\nFor now, I conclude that I have validated the code and that I can use it for a next post. For the time being the same set of parameters (1000 as the number of repeats and 100 as the number of experiments) will be used there.\nNote that, on the fly, we “penciled down” all teams (100 x 1000 repeats, or 100000 teams).\nThis allows us to do a lot more with the data. It all started with a person with a given two-letter initial joining an existing team of seven people.\nThe probability of having a given specific two-letter initial (say AS, XY or QQ) under the assumed conditions (ie all letters are created equal) is 0.147929 %. So, if we would be drawing 100000 times, each combination would pop up 147.93 times.\nFor the simulated data we can tally the number of teams that have specific members on board. Say we are looking for “AS” (does not really matter here as all letters are created equal).\n\nTeams with “AS” as “member eight” of the team: 146 (compare to our expected 147.93),\nTeams with one “AS” as old member (“member 1 through 7”): 954 ,\nTeams with two old “AS” members: 7,\n\nTeams with three “AS” members in the original team: 0,\n\nBut what we are actually looking for is adding “AS” as the eighth member to a team of seven people, where there is already one (or more) “AS” in the original team. It turns out that, in this simulation, there are only 1 out of 100000 teams. Or a probability of only 0.001 %. So indeed quite a rare event."
