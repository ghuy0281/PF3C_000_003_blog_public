It was added to by many generations, and contained various information: diary-type entries on current events, memoirs, letters, political speeches, copies of legal documents, gossips, jokes and anecdotes, financial documents, economic information (price of grain, etc.), philosophical musings, poems, genealogical trees, advice (agricultural, medical, moral) for the descendants and others. The wealth of information in silva is staggering; they contain anything that their authors wished to record for future generations._\n\nI am in no way Polish, Lithuanian, noble. I have no intention to include political speeches, financial documents, poems, nor private family matters or the like. But I like the concept and will probably include from time to time observations and reflections, for the future me or whoever finds the time and interest to read. \n\nThis is how I see this blog. Nothing special. But hey, I have a blog ... \n\n[^1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silva_rerum, 2024-08-15\n\n\n\n",
