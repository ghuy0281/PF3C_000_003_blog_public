## About
silva rerum

mixed type of blog, whatever I considered worthwhile en in welke taal het meest relevant. I kan al wat voorspellen, themes als heemkunde of locale geschiedenis die ik tegenkom, topic that catched my mind in technical and scientifical field, en under the memories tab _memopinions_: memo's, memories and probably some opinions as well. 

Publications, well some publications of the hand of co-workers and or myself. With the remark that I am not an academic, worked a substantial amount of time in closed research within private companies of researach as a service. So publication is rare. 

Never the less open research open source as far asusing public funds. Research data obtained thorugh funding by individuals or private companies I consider as deafualt (ownership by the funding parties). If the funding is by an agency or community the same rule applies.

I only wish that funding agencies ould be more oops, i feel a post coming.
